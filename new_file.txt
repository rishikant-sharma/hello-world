Checkout out to readme-edits and master made this text file disappear.
Checkout out to my_branch made this file reappear. 

This hapened after I pused my changes to origin/my_branch.

After writing the above comments in new_file in my_branch
git is not allowing me to checkout to master or readme-edits.
It is suggesting that I either stash my changes or commit them.

I have pushed the above changes to origin/my_branch

Now I will create a pull request to push new_file to master

Please accept pull request.
